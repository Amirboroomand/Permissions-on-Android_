# Permissions-on-Android_
App permissions help support user privacy by protecting access to the following:

.Restricted data, such as system state and a user's contact information.
.Restricted actions, such as connecting to a paired device and recording audio.

This page provides an overview to how Android permissions work, including a high-level workflow for using permissions, descriptions of different types of permissions, and some best practices for using permissions in your app. Other pages explain how to evaluate whether your app needs to request permissions, declare permissions, request runtime permissions, and restrict how other apps can interact with your app's components.
